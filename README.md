Modern UI design demands performance, fluidity, and precisionâ€”qualities that make animations and graphics stand out. To sharpen my React Native skills and explore new tools, I took on a side project: replicating a sophisticated Dribbble design to the pixel using React Native ReAnimated and React Native Skia with Expo.

My motivation was simple: learn these cutting-edge tools while applying them to practical, modern design patterns. Along the way, I discovered not only how to bring intricate designs to life but also how to optimize for performance without sacrificing interactivity.
